# 🧳 TravelZ

TravelZ is a web application that helps **18–20 year olds find bookable hotels in the United States that allow 18+ check-ins**.

## 🚨 The Problem

Most major hotel search platforms (e.g., Booking.com, Expedia, Hotels.com) do **not** provide a filter by check-in age. Instead, they typically default to showing all hotels regardless of policy. This creates a major obstacle for young travelers because:

- Many hotels in the US require **21+ to check in**.
- Travelers aged **18–20 must call hotels individually** to confirm whether they will be allowed to stay.
- This process is frustrating, time-consuming, and often unreliable.

## ✅ The Solution

**TravelZ** solves this problem by:

- Searching **only hotels that explicitly allow 18+ check-ins**.
- Providing **instant access** to bookable options without needing to call hotels.
- Empowering young travelers with a **clear, trustworthy, and easy-to-use** platform.

With TravelZ, an 18-year-old can confidently book hotels knowing they won’t be turned away at check-in.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Hotel search by destination and date.
- 🏨 Results limited to hotels with **18+ check-in policies**.
- 📱 Simple, modern, and mobile-friendly design.
- 🚀 Fast and reliable booking experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript /
- **Backend:** Node.js, JSON
- **APIs:** Hotel search APIs (with filtering for 18+ check-in policies)

## 📌 Use Case Example

> Alex is 19 and planning a trip to Miami with friends. On Booking.com, Alex sees dozens of hotels but has no idea which ones actually allow 18+ check-ins.
>
> With **TravelZ**, Alex searches Miami → sees only hotels confirmed to allow 18+ check-ins → books with confidence in minutes.
